# Module Xsolla Payments SDK for Android

Allows working with the convenient UI based on [Xsolla Pay Station](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/pay-station/) to receive payments for in-game purchases.

The entry point is the `XPayments` class. The library contains methods for working with payments via access token or access data that allows implementing the following features:
*   purchases for 130+ currencies
*   purchases via 700+ payment methods
*   built-in anti-fraud
*   payment UI localized in 20 languages
*   purchase refund

Payments SDK is required to work with payments when using Store SDK, but it can be used separately for server-side, serverless integrations, or integration with PlayFab servers.
