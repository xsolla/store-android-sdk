> Integrate [Xsolla Mobile SDK](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/mobile/) to enable In-App Payments across mobile platforms within and outside of stores in a platform-compliant way, powered by Pay Station with over 700 payment methods.

The [Sample App](https://github.com/xsolla/store-android-sdk/tree/master/app) represents one of the possible implementations of the login system, inventory, and in-game store based on Xsolla products ([Login](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/login/), [In-Game Store](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/in-game-store/), and [Pay Station](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/pay-station/)).

You can use the demo project in two ways:
* As an example.
* As the initial version of the login system, inventory, and in-game store. You can get an instant result and expand the demo features.

For the demo app, we use a preset project in [Publisher Account](https://publisher.xsolla.com/signup?store_type=sdk) and a fully-configured in-game store. When you launch the demo app, the sign-up/login page is displayed. Sign up in the app or click **More login options >** **Login as a demo user** to log in with a demo account.

The demo project covers the following user scenarios:
* Classic login via a username/email and password
* Social login
* Passwordless login via a one-time code or a link sent in the SMS or email
* Purchase for real or virtual currency
* Consuming items from the player inventory

NOTE: By default, the demo is working in sandbox mode. To test the purchase process, use [test cards](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/pay-station/testing/test-cards/). Sandbox mode only simulates the behavior of a payment method, no real money is involved. You can try out sandbox mode without signing any agreements with Xsolla or paying any fees.

The demo also shows the following user management features:
* User account management
* User attributes customization
