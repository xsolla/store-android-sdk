## Usage

To manage the features of Xsolla products, the library contains a set of classes that let you make requests to the [Pay Station API](https://developers.xsolla.com/pay-station-api/).

After installing and initializing the Store library, implement user authorization logic in your application using [SDK methods](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk-code-references/android-store/#%5B.ext%2FXsolla+Payments+SDK+for+Android%2F%2F%2FPointingToDeclaration%2F%5D%2FMain%2F0).
